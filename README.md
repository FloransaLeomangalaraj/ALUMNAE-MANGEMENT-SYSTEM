# ALUMNAE-MANGEMENT-SYSTEM
An Alumnae Management System helps schools and colleges manage and connect with former students. It stores alumnae details, organizes events like reunions, and shares updates. Alumnae can update their profiles and achievements, promoting networking, communication, and lifelong relationships with the institution.
